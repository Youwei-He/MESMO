# MESMO
Matlab implementation of the Max-value Entropy Search for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization method [1].

To run the code, you should get PlatEMO from https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO

The GP-stuff package is supplied in the .zip file. Or you could get the latest version of GP-stuff from: https://github.com/gpstuff-dev/gpstuff

I am not responsible of the correctness of the code. But I am glad to fix the bugs if you report it. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions on the implementation. Email:1554748356@qq.com
